## Overview

Kustomize works as a standalone binary; also, it's built into `kubectl` (since v1.14). It can be used with off-the-shelf applications like **Helm charts**. Also, it has a deep integration with different **GitOps** tools like ArgoCD, Flux, and many others.

## Plugins

Kustomize has 3 types of plugins `generator`, `transformer`, and `validator`.
